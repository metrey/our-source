Hi,
Khmer Unicode requires to have a right USP10.DLL in your system (system32 / business object / etc.)

The good file size start from 491k (recommended for 703k - but I don't have with me).
I test using usp10.dll size 491k.

Khmer Unicode version 2.x
Visual Studio 2008 with build-in Crystal Report

Good luck,
Metrey,
